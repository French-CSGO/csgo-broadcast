# CSGO Broadcast

Create a [GOTV+ Broadcast](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Broadcast) via HTTP using Express

*I am not good at HTML & CSS*

There is no config or anything, just run it and go to http://localhost:8181/faq and read question 2.

Everything will start working automatically, there is no verification of binary data to ensure it is valid or anything.

I tried to combine all GOTV fragments into a full demo after the broadcast is done but it sadly didn't work. I might try again at a later point.

Update: I have now added a little work around for this, instead of providing a demo download it instead just starts the playcast from the very beginning. This is *hopefully* only temporary.
